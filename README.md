HTML, CSS (Bootstrap),and jquery were all used in creating this portfolio.  First provided image is Portfolio Homepage that simply displays a background-image and nav-bar. The homepage has four nav-bars at the top that bring the user to different pages.  This was compeleted using jquery hide and show.  Portfolio also includes links to GitHub profile, GitHub Repository, and Linkedin.

This is the My Work page of Portfolio that provides access to three of my projects.  Travel repositroy is still a work in progress but does indicate my potential with Jquery, image manipulation, video inclusion, and CSS Bootstrap.
